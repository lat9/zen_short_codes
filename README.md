# ShortCodes for Zen Cart 1.5.8 and later

This **escapsulated** plugin enables a site to use `shortcodes` when generating links to products or categories within a product or category description.  The `shortcode` text is replaced by a link to the respective product or category, making maintenance of those descriptions less time-consuming.
